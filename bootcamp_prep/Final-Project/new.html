                            <p>
                                Linkin Park was formed in 1996 by Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, and Brad Delson, who recruited Joe Hahn, Dave "Phoenix" Farrell, and Mark Wakefield to join their band, initially called Xero. After struggling to secure a record deal, they brought on Chester Bennington as their new vocalist and changed their name to Hybrid Theory, releasing a self-titled EP in 1999. They signed with Warner Bros. Records later that year and changed their name to Linkin Park. The band's current lineup includes Shinoda, Bourdon, Delson, Hahn, and Farrell, with Bennington tragically passing away in 2017. Their debut album, Hybrid Theory, was released in 2000 and launched the band's career, leading them to become one of the most popular and influential rock bands of the 2000s.
