    <h1>Daily Challenge: Not Bad</h1>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a variable called sentence. The value of the variable should be a string that contains the words “not” and “bad”.
            For example, “The movie is not that bad, I like it”.
            </li>
        <li>Create a variable called wordNot where it’s value is the first appearance (ie. the position) of the substring “not” (from the sentence variable).
            </li>
        <li>Create a variable called wordBad where it’s value is the first appearance (ie. the position) of the substring “bad” (from the sentence variable).</li>
        <li>If the word “bad” comes after the word “not”, you should replace the whole “not…bad” substring with “good”, then console.log the result.
            For example, the result here should be : “The movie is good, I like it”</li>
        <li>If the word “bad” does not come after “not” or the words are not in the sentence, console.log the original sentence.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p> Your string is : 'This dinner is not that bad ! You cook well', <br>
        --> the result is : 'This dinner is good ! You cook well' <br>
        <br>
        Your string is : 'This movie is not so bad !'  <br>
        --> the result is : 'This movie is good !' <br>
        <br>
        Your string is : 'This dinner is bad !'  <br>
        --> the result is : 'This dinner is bad !' <br></p>
